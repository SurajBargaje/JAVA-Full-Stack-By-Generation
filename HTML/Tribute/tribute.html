      <h3>Life Story</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Early Life: Subhas Chandra Bose was born in Cuttack, Odisha, India, in a
        Bengali Kayastha family. He studied in England, where he qualified for
        the Indian Civil Service. However, he chose to actively participate in
        India's struggle for independence.
        <br>

        <strong>Role in the Indian National Congress:</strong> Bose was
        initially associated with the Indian National Congress (INC) and became
        its president in 1938. However, he had differences with Mahatma Gandhi
        and other leaders regarding the approach to achieving independence.
        <br />

        <strong> Formation of Forward Bloc:</strong> Subhas Chandra Bose later
        formed the Forward Bloc, a left-wing faction within the Congress, to
        advocate for a more radical and militant approach to independence.
        <br />

        <strong>Escape to Germany and Formation of Azad Hind Fauj:</strong>
        During World War II, Bose sought international support for India's
        cause. He first sought assistance from Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.
        Subsequently, he escaped house arrest in India and reached Germany.
        Later, he formed the Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army or INA) with
        the help of the Axis powers to fight against the British in India. <br>

        <strong>"Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom":</strong> This
        famous slogan reflects Bose's commitment to the cause of independence
        and his call for sacrifice. <br>

        <strong> INA and the Battle of Imphal:</strong> The INA, led by Bose,
        played a significant role in the Burma Campaign during World War II,
        particularly in the Battle of Imphal. The INA fought alongside Japanese
        forces against the British. <br>

        <strong> Disappearance:</strong> Bose's fate remains a mystery. He
        reportedly died in a plane crash in Taiwan on 18 August 1945. However,
        there are various theories and controversies surrounding his death, and
        some believe that he might have survived. <br>
